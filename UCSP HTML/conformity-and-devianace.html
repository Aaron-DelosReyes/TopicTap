         <h1>CONFORMITY AND DEVIANCE</h1> <hr>
            <p>As part of society, sometimes we feel pressure to do or not to do certain acts/decisions in
              front of other people; he/she is defined as either conformist or deviant.
              Let us define what is conformity and deviance.  </p>
            <hr>
          <h2>CONFORMITY</h2>
          <p>Or simply compliance with standards, rules, or law.
            Conformity is defined as “yielding to group pressures” (Crutchfield, 1955). Group
            pressure may take different forms, for example, bullying, persuasion, teasing, criticism,
            etc. Conformity is also known as majority influence (or group pressure).</p> 

          <p>The term conformity is often used to indicate an agreement to the majority position,
            brought about either by a desire to ‘fit in’ or be liked (normative) or because of a desire to
            be correct (informational), or simply to conform to a social role (identification).</p>

          <p>Conformity, the process whereby people change their beliefs, attitudes, actions, or
          perceptions to more closely match those held by groups to which they belong or want to
          belong or by groups whose approval they desire. Conformity has important social
          implications and continues to be actively researched.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>DEVIANCE</h2>
            <p>Any behavior that violates a cultural norm, violation of social rules, and
              conventions. Deviance can vary dramatically across cultures. Cultural norms are relative,
              which makes deviant behavior relative as well. “Deviance” is a concept that describes a
              non-conformity to social norms, values, and civic expectations, while the “deviant” is
              someone whose behavior (notably, not attitudes or beliefs) departs from established moral
              standards. Alcoholics, gamblers, sex deviants, drug addicts, or latecomers in the class are all
              classified as deviants or deviant acts</p> <hr>

                <h3>There are 2 Types of Deviance</h3>
                  <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">
                      <h3>CRIMINAL DEVIANCE </h3>
                      <p>Or Formal deviance includes criminal violation of formally-
                        enacted laws. Examples of formal deviance include robbery, theft, rape, murder, and
                        assault.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="li">
                      <h3>NON-CRIMINAL DEVIANCE </h3>
                      <p>Or Informal deviance refers to violations of informal
                        social norms, which are norms that have not been codified into law. Examples of informal
                        deviance include picking one’s nose, belching loudly, or standing unnecessarily close to
                        another person.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  

              <hr>
            <h3>Classifications of Deviance:</h3>

              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <h4> Physical Deviance</h4>
                  <p>The most visible form of deviance it can evoke stereotypes, stigma,
                    and discrimination. Sociologists classify two types of physical deviance, a. violation of
                    aesthetic norms, (what people should normally look like, including height, weight) and
                    b. physical incapacity, it includes those people with physical disabilities.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h4>Sexual Deviance</h4>
                  <p> Includes exotic, dancers, strippers, sex tourism, and sexual in public
                    restrooms, bisexuality, online sexual predators, prostitute, and other sexual crimes.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h4>Deviance in Cyberspace</h4>
                  <p>Is new relatively phenomenon but comes in many forms:
                    cyberbullying, online gambling, sexting, illegal downloading of music, movies, and
                    readings.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h4>Elite Deviance</h4>
                  <p>Is a condition known to sociologists that exist in a society when the elite
                    of that society no longer believe that the rules apply to them. Acts did by people who
                    have more power in society.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h4>Positive Deviance</h4>
                  <p>An approach to behavioral and social change based on the
                    observation that in any community. This refers to a behavioral and social change
                    approach which is premised on the observation that in any context, certain individuals
                    confronting similar challenges, constraints, and resource deprivations to their peers,
                    will nonetheless employ uncommon but successful behaviors’ or strategies which enable
                    them to find better solutions.</p>
                </li>
              </ol> <hr>
              <p>
                A person conforms if he or she chooses a course of action that a majority favors or that is
socially acceptable. In contrast, an individual deviates if he or she chooses an action that is
not socially acceptable or that a majority does not favor. Clearly, there are countless
situations when a person faces a majority opinion. For example, every time you perform
the simple action of dressing in the morning you face a group of people who, as a majority,
dress a certain way. Will you dress as they do, for instance in jeans and a T-shirt, or will
you dress in another style if you prefer to be different? As you can see, any action that a
person takes in such a circumstance is necessarily either conformity or deviance.
