      <h1>SELF-CONCEPT</h1>  
      <hr>
      <h2>Ideal Self vs Actual Self</h2>
      <p>Imagine yourself looking into a mirror. What do you see? Do you see your
        ideal self or your actual self? <b>ideal self</b>  is the self that you aspire to be. It is the
        one that you hope will possess characteristics similar to that of a mentor or some
        other worldly figure. Your <b>actual self</b>, however, is the one that you actually see. It is
        the self that has characteristics that you were nurtured or, in some cases, born to
        have</p> <hr>
        <h2>Self-Concept</h2>
        <p>The actual self and the ideal self are two broad categories of self-concept.
          <b>Self-concept</b> refers to your awareness of yourself. It is the construct that negotiates
          these two selves. In other words, it connotes first the identification of the ideal self as
          separate from others, and second, it encompasses all the behaviors evaluated in the
          actual self that you engage in to reach the ideal self.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Self-Image</h2>
          <p>The <b>actual self</b> is built on self-knowledge. <b>Self-knowledge</b> is derived from
            social interactions that provide insight into how others react to you. The actual self is
            who we actually are.  It is how we think, how we feel, look, and act. The actual self
            can be seen by others, but because we have no way of truly knowing how others
            view us, the actual self is our <b>self-image</b>.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Ideal-Self</h2>
          <p>The <b>ideal self</b>, on the other hand, is how we want to be. It is an idealized
            image that we have developed over time, based on what we have learned and
            experienced. The ideal self could include components of what our parents have
            taught us, what we admire in others, what our society promotes, and what we think is
            in our best interest.</p>
          <h2>Social Roles </h2>
            <p>There is <b>negotiation</b> that exists between the two selves which is complex
              because there are numerous exchanges between the ideal and actual self. These
              exchanges are exemplified in <b>social roles</b> that are adjusted and re-adjusted, and are
              derived from outcomes of social interactions from infant to adult development.
              Alignment is important. If the way that I am (the actual self) is aligned with the way
              that I want to be (the ideal self), then I will feel a sense of mental well-being or peace
              of mind. If the way that I am is not aligned with how I want to be, the incongruence,
              or lack of alignment, will result in mental distress or anxiety. The greater the level of
              incongruence between the ideal self and real self, the greater the level of resulting
              distress. Personal development modules ultimate aim is greater self-knowledge that
              will lead to higher alignment between these two personality domains</p>
