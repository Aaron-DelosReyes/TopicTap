            <h1>Types of Communicative Strategy</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Since engaging in conversation is also bound by implicit rules, Cohen (1990) states that strategies
                must be used to start and maintain a conversation. Knowing and applying grammar appropriately
                is one of the most basic strategies to maintain a conversation. The following are some strategies that
                people use when communicating.</p>

                <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">
                        <h3>1. Nomination </h3>
                        <p>A speaker carries out nomination to collaboratively and productively establish a topic.
                            Basically, when you employ this strategy, you try to open a topic with the people you are
                            talking to. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2. When beginning a topic in a conversation, especially if it does not arise from a previous topic,
                            you may start off with news inquiries and news announcements as they promise extended
                            talk. Most importantly, keep the conversational environment open for opinions until the
                            prior topic shuts down easily and initiates a smooth end. This could efficiently signal the
                            beginning of a new topic in the conversation.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3>2. Restriction </h3>
                        <p>Restriction in communication refers to any limitation you may have as a speaker. When
                            communicating in the classroom, in a meeting, or while hanging out with your friends, you
                            are typically given specific instructions that you must follow. These instructions confine you
                            as a speaker and limit what you can say.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> For example, in your class, you might be asked by your teacher to brainstorm on peer
                            pressure or deliver a speech on digital natives. In these cases, you cannot decide to talk
                            about something else. On the other hand, conversing with your friends during ordinary
                            days can be far more casual than these examples. Just the same, remember to always be on
                            point and avoid sideswiping from the topic during the conversation to avoid communication
                            breakdown.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3> 3. Turn-taking</h3>
                        <p> Sometimes people are given unequal opportunities to talk because others take much time
                            during the conversation. Turn-taking pertains to the process by which people decide who
                            takes the conversational floor. There is a code of behavior behind establishing and sustaining
                            a productive conversation, but the primary idea is to give all communicators a chance to
                            speak.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Remember to keep your words relevant and reasonably short enough to express your views
                            or feelings. Try to be polite even if you are trying to take the floor from another speaker. Do
                            not hog the conversation and talk incessantly without letting the other party air out their
                            own ideas. To acknowledge others, you may employ visual signals like a nod, a look, or a step
                            back, and you could accompany these signals with spoken cues such as “What do you think?”
                            or “You wanted to say something?”</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3>4. Topic Control </h3>
                        <p>Topic control covers how procedural formality or informality affects the development of
                            topic in conversations. For example, in meetings, you may only have a turn to speak after the
                            chairperson directs you to do so. Contrast this with a casual conversation with friends over
                            lunch or coffee where you may take the conversational floor anytime. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Remember that regardless of the formality of the context, topic control is achieved
                            cooperatively. This only means that when a topic is initiated, it should be collectively
                            developed by avoiding unnecessary interruptions and topic shifts. You can make yourself
                            actively involved in the conversation without overly dominating it by using minimal
                            responses like “Yes,” “Okay,” “Go on”; asking tag questions to clarify information briefly like
                            “You are excited, aren’t you?”, “It was unexpected, wasn’t it?”; and even by laughing!</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3>5. Topic Shifting</h3>
                        <p> Topic shifting, as the name suggests, involves moving from one topic to another. In other
                            words, it is where one part of a conversation ends and where another begins.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> When shifting from one topic to another, you have to be very intuitive. Make sure that the
                            previous topic was nurtured enough to generate adequate views. You may also use effective
                            conversational transitions to indicate a shift like “By the way,” “In addition to what you said,”
                            “Which reminds me of,” and the like.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3>6. Repair </h3>
                        <p> Repair refers to how speakers address the problems in speaking, listening, and
                            comprehending that they may encounter in a conversation. For example, if everybody in the
                            conversation seems to talk at the same time, give way and appreciate other’s initiative to set
                            the conversation back to its topic</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Repair is the self-righting mechanism in any social interaction (Schegloff et al, 1977). If
                            there is a problem in understanding the conversation, speakers will always try to address
                            and correct it. Although this is the case, always seek to initiate the repair.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <h3> 7. Termination</h3>
                        <p> Termination refers to the conversation participants’ close-initiating expressions that end a
                            topic in a conversation. Most of the time, the topic initiator takes responsibility to signal the
                            end of the discussion as well.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Although not all topics may have clear ends, try to signal the end of the topic through
                            concluding cues. You can do this by sharing what you learned from the conversation.
                            Aside from this, soliciting agreement from the other participants usually completes the
                            discussion of the topic meaningfully. </p>
