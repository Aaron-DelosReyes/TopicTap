        <h1>The Evolution of Traditional Media to New Media</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Prehistoric Age (1500 BC – 1500 AD)</h2>
        <p>The Prehistoric refers to the time before the existence of written or recorded
          history. According to archeologist, the Prehistoric Age occurred some 4.5 million
          years ago or approximately 30, 000 years ago. It also known as Stone Age and the
          Metal Age. They are called such because of the kind of tools that the prehistoric
          people used during those times. The tools were relatively crude, archeologist believe
          that a system of writing hat not yet existed during this era.</p>

          <p>The prehistoric men learned how to sharpen their tools and use them for
            hunting, they also acquired the knowledge on how to use these materials in carving
            stones. Eventually, this paved the way for them to create a system of writing, which
            marked the start of the historic period.</p>

            <p>The Clay tablets in Mesopotamia (2400 BC), the
              early writing tablet recording the allocation of beer,
              3100-3000 B. C.E., another notable invention was the
              Printing press using wood blocks (220 AD), originated in
              china, it is technique or printing text, images or patterns
              used widely throughout East Asia.</p> <hr>
              <h2>
                Industrial Age (1700s-1930s)
                </h2> 
                <p>The Industrial Age began in the 18th century in Great Britain when the country
                  made drastic reforms to improve their economy. Technology shifted from using hand
                  tools to operating power-driven machines. Most people associated factories and
                  machines to industries.</p>
                  <p>Selling of goods boosted during the Industrial Age. The concept of mass
                    production or manufacturing of goods in large quantities was introduced, increasing
                    the demand for bigger and better machines. Special machines were fabricated to
                    meet the specific needs of different factories.</p>
                    <p>The Industrial Age has improved the people’s
                      way of living as new inventions such as steamboats
                      and steam locomotives, made transportation faster.
                      However some business owners during this era
                      focused only on earning profit so they took
                      advantage of the poor economic condition of the
                      working class. When the steam press was invented,
                      the printing of materials like newspapers became
                      much faster, cheaper and easier.</p>
                      <p>Before this development, publishers used to
                        receive financial support from political parties and
                        rich patrons so that the latter can be features in the
                        newspaper. When printing cost marked down, publishers started to print articles for
                        the common interest of the public. The earlier injustices experienced by the laborers
                        were also published in the newspaper. Communication during the Industrial Age also
                        became viable because of the invention of the telegraph. The telegraphy key used to
                        send the famous message “ What Hath God Wroght” over the prototype telegraph line
                        between Baltimore and Washington D.C. in 1844. A mechanical typewriter used for
                        writing characters was also invented around 1800.</p> <hr>
                        <h2>Electronic Age (1930s – 1980s)</h2>
                        <p>Electronic refers to an object that has electronic components, such as sensors,
                          microchips, which functions once it is connected to an electronic outlet. The
                          Industrial Age and Electronic Age are quite similar – they thrived in the
                          manufacturing industries, the only different because of the equipment used.
                          Example Transportation and Communication.</p>
                          <p>By early 1954, Transistor Radio was introduced by Texas instruments (TI)
                            had perfected production to the point that transistors became cheap enough for use
                            in consumer items.
                            The television began its popularity in the 1940s. It was a novel item that
                            everyone wanted to have. It opened the doors for a variety of new experiences for all
                            Americans.</p> <hr>
                            <h2>Information (Digital) Age (1900s – 2000s)</h2>
                            <p>The Information Age has upgraded what it can offer to consumers in terms of
                              gadgets and devices that can make their way of life not only functional and
                              comfortable, but also offer endless possibilities.</p>
                              <p>Digital Age or Informational Age is a period in human history characterized by
                                the shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through
                                industrialization, to an economy
                                based on information
                                computerization. The internet paved
                                the way advanced the used of
                                microelectronics with the invention
                                of personal computers, devices
                                wearable technology. Moreover,
                                voice, image, sounds, and data are
                                digitalized.
                                This is the period of computers, laptops, smartphones and social media.</p>
