         <h1>THE POWER OF PERSONAL DECLARATIONS</h1>
         <p>by Dr. Emily De Carlo</p><hr>

         <p>So often we accept the declarations that others have made concerning our
            own lives, well-being or fate. It is imperative that we recognize that in order to
            achieve what we want in life, we must not give our power away to others by
            accepting their declarations concerning our affairs. When one decides that he or she
            will boldly declare good fortune, wellness, joy, etc. relative to his or her life, all of
            heaven will break loose! Goodness and mercy shall surely follow.</p> <br>

        <p>From birth, we are often told what we are going to be. Sometimes, this is a
            good thing, but suppose you have been told time and time again that "you will not
            amount to anything just like your mother or father"? This is a dangerous declaration
            because it sets into motion the actualization of an unwanted occurrence. All of us
            want to amount to something! In order to counteract this and all of the negative
            declarations with their destructive potential, one must consciously replace them with
            one's own declarations. In so doing, you are now in control of setting into action what
            you really want to occur. You can declare that goodness and mercy shall surely
            follow you all the days of your life!</p> <hr>
            
            <p>The following are some declarations that you may want to make concerning
                your life:</p>
            <p><b>I Declare:</b></p>
                <p>that I am totally free of all addictions.                </p>
                <p>that I will survive any attempts of others to control my life.                </p>
                <p>that I am totally free of all addictions.                </p>
                <p>that I will survive any attempts of others to control my life.                </p>
                <p>that I am free in my mind, body, and emotions                </p>
                <p>that I am free to set goals and reach them.                </p>
                <p>that I am a loving individual with the capacity to give love.                </p>
                <p>that I will contribute to the welfare of others.                </p>
                <p>that I will be an ambassador of goodwill to all I meet on the journey.                </p>
                <p>that I will be a good example for others to follow.                </p>
                <p>that I will help all that I can to reach their goals.                </p>
                <p>that I will speak words of encouragement to others.                </p>
                <p>that I will find the goodness in life and focus on it.                </p>
                <p>that I will not succumb to the negative influences of others.                </p>
                <p>that I will read the information that will encourage my personal,
                    and spiritual growth.</p>
                <p>that I will commit to being the best I can be.                </p>
                    <hr>
                <p>These declarations are meant to encourage you to take control of the
                    influences in your life. They are suggestions as to what positive things you can speak
                    about your own life instead of accepting whatever has been said about you in the
                    past. You now have the authority to plant the seeds of love, encouragement and
                    victory in your garden, thereby crowding out the weeds of negativity that may already
                    have taken root! Just as in a garden, you may have to pull and pull until you get
                    some weeds out. Sometimes, the negative comments and declarations of others
                    have taken such a stronghold in our lives, that we must persist until we see the
                    bough not only fall, but break into pieces. Don't be discouraged if you don't reach
                    your goals overnight. Just remember that even a small stream of water will crack
                    concrete eventually!</p> <hr>
