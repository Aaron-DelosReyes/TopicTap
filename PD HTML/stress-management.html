           <h1>Stress Management</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Dictionary definitions do not quite capture the meaning of stress as it is seen
            and experienced in the world of work. One of the Webster’s definitions describes it
            as an “…emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension.”</p>
          <p>A practical way of defining stress is the feeling one gets from prolonged,
            pent-up emotions. If the emotions you experience are pleasant and desirable – joy,
            elation, ecstasy, delight – you usually feel free to let them show. They are not suppressed. Therefore; positive emotions do not usually cause stress. Negative
            emotions, on the other hand, are more often held inside. They are hidden. You suffer
            quietly and you experience stress. Do not confuse positive situations with positive
            emotions. A wedding, for example, is a positive situation that often brings about the
            negative emotions of anxiety and tension. So stress can exist in great situations.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Causes and Effects of Stress</h2>
          <p>Just as there is great variety in the range of emotions you might experience,
            there are many possible manifestations of stress – in your private life and in your
            working life. Here are some words that describe the emotions associated (as cause
            and effect) with stress.</p>
          <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">
              <p> &bull; Anxiety</p>
              <p> &bull; Pressure</p>
              <p> &bull; Misery</p>
              <p> &bull; Strain</p>
              <p> &bull; Desperation</p>
              <p> &bull; Tension</p>
              <p> &bull; Anger</p>
              <p> &bull; Panic</p>
              <p> &bull; Dejection</p>

            </li>
          </ol>

<p>Prolonged stress can be devastating; burnout, breakdown, and depression
  are some of the potential results of long-term, unmanaged stress. By wearing a
  mask, you may expect to hide stress caused by problems in your personal life and
  not let them influence your performance on the job. This will probably not work. The
  more you try to hold your emotions in, the greater the pressure build-up will be.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Everyday frustrations cause stress build-up</h2>
<p>From the time you wake up until you go to sleep, you may be confronted with
  a succession of stressful situations. Managing to get yourself (and possibly a spouse
  and children) out of bed and ready to face the day can be a challenge to your
  patience and ingenuity. Driving to school or work can be harrowing – especially if
  you’re running late. You may experience frustration in arranging to get the car
  repaired. You may face conflicts in school or at work, such as coping with unrealistic
  deadlines, equipment failures, or unexpected bad weather. If part of your job is
  selling, you may experience feelings of rejection when most of your customers say
  “no.”</p>
<p>A series of stressful and frustrating experiences throughout the day can
  cause you to lie awake at night in an emotional turmoil – unable to get needed rest.
  You face the next day with less emotional and physical stamina. After another
  stressful day and another night without rest, you may have even less emotional
  strength and stability. Therefore, stress build-up, if not resolved, continues day after
  day.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Problems in our personal life can be devastating</h2>
<p>Surviving the normal, everyday stress described above can be difficult. But
  far more serious and painful circumstances can create long-term stress. More
  serious stressful circumstances may include separation from loved ones, personal
  illness, or illness of a loved one, death of someone you care about, or conflict with a
  spouse or close friend. Other major causes of stress are problems with drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, care of children and elderly relatives, chronic
  mental illness, injury, physical handicaps, even moving to a new home, if you’ve lived
  in the same place for more than 10 years. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Managing your personal finances can be another stressful experience. This
  can be a problem no matter what your income level, but it is especially difficult if you
  must support a family and do not earn enough to live comfortably. Unpaid bills,
  unwise use of credit, and budget limitations can make life difficult.</p>
<hr>
<h2>A common cause of stress is dealing with life’s transitions</h2>
<p>This is especially true when a person must cope with too many transitions all
  at once. For example, Ellen has just completed a program in fashion merchandising.
  She is eager to get started on her new job. Her mother is ill and requires care. Her
  father died a few months ago. Ellen’s new job requires that she relocate to a town
  100 miles from home. The move, a new career, and a change in family relationships
  may cause excessive stress for her. Too many changes have arrived at the same
  time.</p>
