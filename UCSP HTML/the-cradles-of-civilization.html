              <h2>1. TIGRIS-EUPHRATES RIVER CIVILIZATION OF MESOPOTAMIA</h2>
              <p>Mesopotamia is a region of southwest Asia in the Tigris and Euphrates river system
                that benefited from the area’s climate and geography to host the beginnings of human
                civilization. Its history is marked by many important inventions that changed the
                world, including the concept of time, math, the wheel, sailboats, maps, and writing.</p> <br>
              <p>Mesopotamia is also defined by a changing succession of ruling bodies from different
                areas and cities that seized control over a period of thousands of years.</p><br>
              <p>Tigris and Euphrates river made possible the large-scale agriculture, allowing people to
                settle and farm in one area.</p><br>
              <p>Mesopotamia is characterized as, disorganized collection of city-states united by trade,
                by the cuneiform script, and by shared religion with its characterized ziggurat temples</p><br>

              <h2>2. THE NILE VALLEY CIVILIZATION OF EGYPT</h2>
              <p>The Ancient Egyptian civilization, famous for its pyramids, pharaohs, mummies, and
                tombs, flourished for thousands of years. But what was its lasting impact? Learn how
                Ancient Egypt contributed to society with its many cultural developments, particularly
                in language and mathematics.</p><br>
              <p>Known as “Gift of Nile”.</p><br>
              <p>Ancient Egypt is known for its architectural achievements, for its hieroglyphics, for its
                elaborate religion, which emphasized life after death, which leads to the development of
                mummification.</p><br>

              <h2>3. THE YELLOW RIVER CIVILIZATION OF CHINA</h2>
              <p>In Chinese history, the Yellow River is not just a river; it stands for the origins of
                culture and civilization. It played an important role in the early development of Chinese
                civilization</p><br>
              <p>Chinese refer to the Yellow river as "the Mother River" and "the Cradle of Chinese
                Civilization". That is because the Yellow River was the birthplace of ancient Chinese
                civilizations in the Xia (2100–1600 BC) and Shang (1600–1046 BC) eras — the most
                prosperous region in early Chinese history.</p><br>
              <p>The yellow river valley was settled by farmers.</p><br>

              <h2>4. INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION OF INDIA</h2>
              <p>The Indus Valley Civilization existed through its early years of 3300-1300 BCE, and its
                mature period of 2600-1900 BCE.</p><br>
              <p>The area of this civilization extended along the Indus River from what today is
                northeast Afghanistan, into Pakistan and northwest India. The Indus Civilization was
                the most widespread of the three early civilizations of the ancient world, along with
                Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were thought to be the
                two great cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, emerging around 2600 BCE along the
                Indus River Valley in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan.</p><br>
              <p>Their discovery and excavation in the 19th and 20th centuries provided important
                archaeological data about ancient cultures.</p><br>
              <p>It is located in modern Pakistan.</p><br>
              <p>The ruins of this civilization, in such sites as Harappa, Dholavira, and Mohenjo Daro,
                discovered in the early 1920s reveal that it was probably the largest among the four ancient
                civilizations.</p><br>

              <h2>5. THE ROMAN REPUBLIC</h2>
              <p>Beginning in the eighth century B.C., Ancient Rome grew from a small town on central
                Italy’s Tiber River into an empire that at its peak encompassed most of continental
                Europe, Britain, much of western Asia, northern Africa, and the Mediterranean
                islands.</p><br>
              <p>Among the many legacies of Roman dominance is the widespread use of the Romance
                languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian) derived from Latin,
                the modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a
                major world religion.</p><br>
              <p>The Romans achieved greatness in their military, political, and social institutions.</p><br>
              <p>Some of the most significant influence of Rome are the Western alphabet of 26 letters
                and the calendar of 12 months and 365.25 days are only two simple examples of the
                cultural legacy which Rome has contributed to Western civilization.</p><br>
