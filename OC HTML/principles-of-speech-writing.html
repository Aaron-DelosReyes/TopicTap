          <h1>The Speech Writing Process</h1> <hr>
          <p>Just like events planning, or any other activities, writing an effective speech follows certain
            steps or processes. The process for writing is not chronological or linear; rather, it is recursive. That
            means you have the opportunity to repeat a writing procedure indefinitely, or produce multiple
            drafts first before you can settle on the right one. </p>

                      on your purpose. If you are free to decide on a topic, choose one that really interests you. There
                      are a variety of strategies used in selecting a topic, such as using your personal experiences,
                      discussing with your family members or friends, free writing, listing, asking questions, or
                      semantic webbing.</p>
                    <p><b>Narrowing down a topic</b> means making your main idea more specific and focused. The
                      strategies in selecting a topic can also be used when you narrow down a topic.
                      In the example below, “Defining and developing effective money management skills of Grade 11
                      students” is the specific topic out of a general one, which is “Effective money management.”</p>

                        <p>Data gathering is the stage where you collect ideas, information, sources, and references
                          relevant or related to your specific topic. This can be done by visiting the library, browsing
                          the web, observing a certain phenomenon or event related to your topic, or conducting an
                          interview or survey. The data that you will gather will be very useful in making your speech
                          informative, entertaining, or persuasive.</p>

                          <h3>Writing Patterns</h3>
                          <p>Writing patterns, in general, are structures that will help you organize the ideas related to your
                            topic. Examples are biographical, categorical/topical, causal, chronological, comparison/contrast,
                            problem-solution, and spatial.</p>

                          <h3>Outline</h3>
                          <p>An outline is a hierarchical list that shows the relationship of your ideas. Experts in public
                            speaking state that once your outline is ready, two-thirds of your speech writing is finished. A
                            good outline helps you see that all the ideas are in line with your main idea or message. The

                            how you want your ideas to develop.</p>

                                <p>One major consideration in developing the body of your speech is the focus or central idea. The

                                <p>The introduction is the foundation of your speech. Here, your primary goal is to get the attention
                                  of your audience and present the subject or main idea of your speech. Your first few words
                                  should do so. The following are some strategies.</p>
                                <p> &bull; Use a real-life experience and connect that experience to your subject.</p>
                                <p> &bull; Use practical examples and explain their connection to your subject.</p>
                                <p> &bull; Start with a familiar or strong quote and then explain what it means.</p>

                                  emphasizes the message, and calls for action. While the primary goal of the introduction is to
                                  get the attention of your audience, the conclusion aims to leave the audience with a memorable
                                  statement. The following are some strategies.</p>
                                <p> &bull; Begin your conclusion with a restatement of your message.</p>
                                <p> &bull; Use positive examples, encouraging words, or memorable lines from songs or stories familiar
                                  to your audience</p>
                                <p> &bull; Ask a question or series of questions that can make your audience reflect or ponder.</p>

                                <ol class="ol">
                                  <p>1. Keep your words short and simple. Your speech is meant to be heard by your audience, not read.</p>
                                  <p>2. Avoid jargon, acronyms, or technical words because they can confuse your audience.</p>
                                  <p>3. Make your speech more personal. Use the personal pronoun “I,” but take care not to overuse it.
                                    When you need to emphasize collectiveness with your audience, use the personal pronoun “we.”</p>
                                  <p>4. Use active verbs and contractions because they add to the personal and conversational tone of
                                    your speech.</p>
                                  <p>5. Be sensitive of your audience. Be very careful with your language, jokes, and nonverbal cues.</p>
                                  <p>6. Use metaphors and other figures of speech to effectively convey your point.</p>
                                  <p>7. Manage your time well; make sure that the speech falls under the time limit.</p>
