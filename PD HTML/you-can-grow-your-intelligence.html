           <h1>You can grow your intelligence</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>New Research Shows the Brain Can Be Developed Like a Muscle</p>
          <p>Many people think of the brain as a mystery. They don’t know much about
            intelligence and how it works. When they do think about what intelligence is, many
            people believe that a person is born either smart, average, or dumb—and stays that
            way for life. But new research shows that the brain is more like a muscle—it changes
            and gets stronger when you use it. And scientists have been able to show just how
            the brain grows and gets stronger when you learn. Everyone knows that when you lift
            weights, your muscles get bigger and you get stronger. A person who can’t lift 20
            pounds when they start exercising can get strong enough to lift 100 pounds after
            working out for a long time. That’s because the muscles become larger and stronger
            with exercise. And when you stop exercising, the muscles shrink and you get
            weaker. That’s why people say “Use it or lose it!” But most people don’t know that
            when they practice and learn new things, parts of their brain change and get larger a
            lot like muscles do when they exercise.
            Inside the cortex of
            the brain are billions of tiny
            nerve cells, called neurons. </p>
            <p>  The nerve cells have branches
              connecting them to other cells
              in a complicated network.
              Communication between
              these brain cells is what allows
              us to think and solve
              problems.
              When you learn new things, these tiny connections in the brain actually
              multiply and get stronger. The more
              that you challenge your mind to learn,
              the more your brain cells grow. Then,
              things that you once found very hard
              or even impossible to do—like
              speaking a foreign language or doing
              algebra—seem to become easy. The
              result is a stronger, smarter brain.</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>How Do We Know the Brain Can Grow Stronger?</h2>
            <p>Scientists started thinking that the human brain could develop and change
              when they studied animals’ brains. They found out that animals who lived in a
              challenging environment, with other animals and toys to play with, were different
              from animals who lived alone in bare cages. While the animals who lived alone just
              ate and slept all the time, the ones who lived with different toys and other animals
              were always active. They spent a lot of time figuring out how to use the toys and how
              to get along with the other animals.</p>
              <p>These animals had more
                connections between the nerve cells in
                their brains. The connections were bigger
                and stronger, too. In fact, their whole
                brains were about 10% heavier than the
                brains of the animals who lived alone
                without toys. The animals who were
                exercising their brains by playing with
                toys and each other were also
                “smarter”—they were better at solving
                problems and learning new things.
                Even old animals got smarter and developed more connections in their
                brains when they got the chance to play with new toys and other animals. When
                scientists put very old animals in the cage with younger animals and new toys to
                explore, their brains also grew by about 10%!s</p> <hr>
                
                <h2>The Key to Growing the Brain: Practice!</h2>
                <p>From the first day they are born, babies are hearing people around them talk—all
                  day, every day, to the baby and to each other. They have to try to make sense of
                  these strange sounds and figure out what they mean. In a way, babies are exercising
                  their brains by listening hard. Later, when they need to tell their parents what they
                  want, they start practicing talking
                  themselves. At first, they just make goo-
                  goo sounds. Then, words start coming.
                  And by the time they are three years old,
                  most can say whole sentences almost
                  perfectly. Once children learn a
                  language, they don’t forget it. The child’s
                  brain has changed—it has actually gotten
                  smarter. This can happen because
                  learning causes permanent changes in
                  the brain. The babies’ brain cells get
                  larger and grow new connections
                  between them. These new, stronger connections make the child’s brain stronger and
                  smarter, just like a weightlifter’s big muscles make them strong.</p> <hr>

                  <h2>The Real Truth About “Smart” and “Dumb”</h2>
                  <p>No one thinks babies are stupid
                    because they can’t talk. They just haven’t learned how to yet. But some people will
                    call a person dumb if they can’t solve math problems, or spell a word right, or read
                    fast—even though all these things are learned with practice. At first, no one can read
                    or solve equations. But with practice, they can learn to do it. And the more a person learns, the easier it gets to learn new things—because their brain “muscles” have
                    gotten stronger!</p>

                    <p>The students everyone thinks as the “smartest” may not have been
                      born any different from anyone else. But before they started school, they may have
                      started to practice reading. They had already started to build up their “reading
                      muscles.” Then, in the classroom, everyone said, “That’s the smartest student in the
                      class.” They don’t realize that any of the other students could learn to do as well if
                      they exercised and practiced reading as much. Remember, all of those other
                      students learned to speak at least one whole language already—something that
                      grownups find very hard to do. They just need to build up their “reading muscles” too.</p>


                      <hr>
                      <h2>What Can You Do to Get Smarter?</h2>
                      <p>Just like a weightlifter or a basketball player, to
                        be a brain athlete, you have to exercise and practice. By practicing, you make your
                        brain stronger. You also learn skills that let you use your brain in a smarter way—just
                        like a basketball player learns new moves. But many people miss out on the chance
                        to grow a stronger brain because they think they can’t do it, or that it’s too hard. It
                        does take work, just like becoming stronger physically or becoming a better ball
                        player does. Sometimes it even hurts! But when you feel yourself get better and
                        stronger, all the work is worth it!</p>
