          <h1>ENCOURAGEMENT 101: The Courage to Be Imperfect</h1>
          <p>by Timothy D. Evans, Ph.D.</p><hr>

          <p>Encouragement is the key ingredient for improving your relationships with
            others. It is the single most important skill necessary for getting along with others –
            so important that the lack of it could be considered the primary cause of conflict and
            misbehavior. Encouragement develops a person’s psychological hardiness and
            social interest. Encouragement is the lifeblood of a relationship. And yet, this simple
            concept is often very hard to put into practice.</p>

            <br> 
          <p>Encouragement is not a new idea. Its spiritual connotation dates back to the
            Bible in Hebrews 3:11 which states “Encourage one another daily.” Encouragement,
            as a psychological idea, was developed by psychiatrist Alfred Adler in the early
            20th century and continued to evolve through the work of Adler’s follower Rudolph
            Dreikurs. However, even today, relatively few educators, parents, psychologists,
            leaders or couples have utilized this valuable concept. Most of the time, people
            mistakenly use a technique like praise in an effort to “encourage” others.</p> <br>

            <p>Half the job of encouragement lies in avoiding discouraging words and
              actions. When children or adults misbehave, it is usually because they are
              discouraged. Instead of building them up, we tear them down; instead of recognizing
              their efforts and improvements, we point out mistakes; instead of allowing them to
              belong through shared decision-making and meaningful contributions, we isolate and
              label them.</p> <br>

            <p>Most of us are skilled discouragers. We have learned how to bribe, reward
              and, when that fails, to punish, criticize, nag, threaten, interrogate and emotionally
              withdraw. We do this as an attempt to control those we love, bolstered by the
              mistaken belief that we are responsible for the behavior of everyone around us,
              especially our spouses and children. These attempts to control behavior create
              atmospheres of tension and conflict in many houses.</p> <hr>

            <h3>Most commonly, we discourage in five general ways:</h3>
              <ol class="ol" >
                <li class="li">
                  <p>&bull; We set standards that are too high for others to meet because we are overly
                    ambitious.</p> 
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <p>&bull; We focus on mistakes as a way to motivate change or improved behavior. </p>
                </li>


                <li class="li">
                  <p>&bull; We make constant comparisons (self to others, siblings to one another).</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <p>&bull; We automatically give a negative spin to the actions of others.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <p>&bull; We dominate others by being overly helpful, implying that they are unable to
                    do it as well.</p>
                </li>
              </ol> <hr>
              <p>
                Encouragement is not a technique nor is it a special language used to gain
compliance. Encouragement conveys the idea that all human beings are worthwhile,
simply because they exist. In one sentence, Mr. Rogers does more for a child’s
sense of adequacy than a hundred instances of praise when he says, “I like you just
the way you are.” Not I like you when you do it well enough, fast enough and get it
all correct. Encouragement develops children’s psychological hardiness -- their
ability to function and recover when things aren’t going their way.
              </p> <br>
              <p>Encouragement enhances a feeling of belonging which leads to greater social
                interest. Social interest is the tendency for people to unite themselves with other
                human beings and to accomplish their tasks in cooperation with others. The Junior
                League mission of “developing the potential of women and improving communities
                through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers” is rooted in the idea
                of social interest.</p> <br>

                <p>The first step to becoming an encouraging person is to learn to distinguish
                  encouragement from discouragement. As a rule, ask yourself: Whatever I say or
                  do, will it bring me closer together or farther apart from this person?
                  We all have the power to be more encouraging people. The choice, as
                  always, is yours.</p> <hr>
