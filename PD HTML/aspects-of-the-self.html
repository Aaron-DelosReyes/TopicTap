        <h1>ASPECTS OF THE SELF</h1> <hr>
            <p>The self-concept is represented by several aspects of the self. It is conceived
                as collection of multiple, context-dependent selves. This construct believes that
                context activates particular regions of self-knowledge and self-relevant feedback
                affects self-evaluations and affect. A deeper look on the different aspects of self can
                identify specific areas for self-regulation, stability and improvement. <br> <br>
                In a nutshell, an individual is composed of three basic but very different
                aspects of the self. They are the physical or tangible aspects as they relate to the
                body, the intellectual and conscious aspects as they relate to the mind, and the
                emotional and intuitive aspects as they relate to the spirit. All three aspects of the
                self work together in perfect harmony when attention is paid to all three
                simultaneously. <br><br>
                Many individuals put a strong emphasis on the physical aspect of the self.
                The body is tangible, obvious, and we respond to it easily. More time and money is
                spent on enhancing the physical component than either of the other two aspects.
                This does not mean, however, that the body is healthy or strong. The body provides
                a place to house the spirit (often experienced as feelings) and the mind (often
                experienced as thought). <br><br>
                It may be important to some that their mind be prominent and well educated.
                The mind is important, as it is the part of the self that directs the other two aspects.
                The mind learns what to do and communicates the information to the body and the
                feelings. What the mind believes, the body manifests or acts on, and the emotions
                feel, or respond with. People store both healthy and destructive thoughts and beliefs
                and responds to life's circumstances in the most prominent manner. The mind
                provides access creativity and serenity which are necessary for such processes as
                prayer, forgiveness, acceptance, and passion. <br><br>
                The human emotions are the most feared aspect of the self, as individuals
                are reluctant and unprepared to manage them. Managing feelings is like trying to
                hold water in the palm of your hand. They are illusive and deceptive. A decision
                made under emotional stress and strain usually impacts emotions negatively.
                Negative emotions that are not managed are stored and repressed. Repression is
                destructive to a content self since all feelings, not only negative ones are stored
                away. Accessing feelings when they are needed now becomes difficult, leaving the
                individual numb and hopeless. <br><br>
                For instance, a girl realizes that she is giving much attention on the physical
                aspects and less attention on her intellectual self. In this way, she can discover how
                much money and time spent maintaining her physique and its consequences in her
                grades. By this honest evaluation of herself, she can plan effective actions to
                improve her study habits. She can start seeking for help and for related books to
                read or browse articles to help her improve her study habits.</p> <hr>
