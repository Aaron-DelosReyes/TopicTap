          <h1>Organizing and Delivering a
            Persuasive Speech</h1> <hr>
            <h2>Definition of Persuasive Speech</h2>
            <p>Persuasive speaking is the form of communication that people of diverse backgrounds mostly
              engage in. This kind of speech can center on any arguably interesting topic under the sun. When you
              deliver your persuasive speech, your primary goal is to influence the thoughts, feelings, actions, and
              behaviors or attitudes of your listeners (Gamble & Gamble, 2012). Likewise, you also aim to change
              their perception and convince them that your argument is more important, practical, attainable, or
              feasible. In essence, you—as a persuasive speaker—advocate for whatever your message is.</p> <hr>

              <h2>Types of Claims in Persuasive Speech</h2>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <p><b>1. Speech that Questions Fact</b></p>
                  <p>This type questions the existence of a particular event or happening. In this case, the
                    persuasive speaker poses questions of fact, derives conclusions from different sources of
                    information, and attempts to convince the audience to believe in his/her ideas.</p><br>

                  <p><b>2. Speech that Questions Value</b></p>
                  <p>This type focuses on questions of value regarding topics on the self, family, friendship,
                    religion, government, freedom, love, and money, among others. In this case, the persuasive
                    speaker (1) makes a statement or claim which reflects his/her judgment, (2) attempts to convince
                    his/her audience of his/her judgment, and (3) justifies it based on standards.</p><br>

                  <p><b>3. Speech that Questions Policy</b></p>
                  <p>This type questions the current state of things which can impact the future. In this case, the
                    persuasive speaker asks relevant questions that can help in making a decision on whether or
                    not something should be implemented, observed, or done.</p><br>

              <hr>
              <h2>Organizational Patterns</h2>
              <p>The following are some of the suggested patterns that you can use to organize your persuasive
                speech.</p>
                <ol class="ol">
                  <li class="li">
                    <p><b>1. A. F.O.R.E.S.T</b></p>
                    <p>. (anecdotes, facts and figures, opinion, rhetorical questions, emotive language,
                      superlatives, tripling)</p>
                      <ol class="ol">
                        <li class="li">
                          <p>1. <b>Anecdotes</b> Begin your speech with a personal story, observation, or experience. </p>
                          <p>2. <b>Facts and figures</b> Provide striking statistics that can support your ideas. </p>
                          <p>3. <b>Opinion</b> You can begin your statement with, “I believe that…”.</p>
                          <p>4. <b>Rhetorical question</b> Think of and add engaging rhetorical questions (i.e., questions
                            which do not intend to elicit answers, but to make a point).</p>
                          <p>5. <b>Emotive language</b> Appeal to your audience’s emotion.</p>
                          <p>6. <b>Superlatives</b> Use superlatives to exaggerate an idea.</p>
                          <p>7. <b>Tripling</b> The rule of three in the English writing principle simply entails using three
                            words together to reinforce your point. This may add to the effectiveness of your
                            persuasion. A classic example is Julius Caesar’s statement: “Veni, vidi, vici” (I came, I saw,
                            I conquered).</p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>

                  <li class="li">
                    <p><b>2. Problem-Solution</b></p>
                    <p>Here’s how:</p>
                    <p> 1. Identify the problem.</p>
                    <p> 2. Provide a solution, which will show the practicality of your proposal.</p>
                    <p>For Example: </p>
                      <ol class="ol">
                        <li class="li">
                          <p>A.  <b>Purpose</b> Persuade listeners that the LGBT community should be protected from
                            discrimination.</p>
                          <p>B.  <b>Main Point</b>  LGBT members deserve to be protected by the state against exclusivity in any
                            workplace or office.</p>
                          <p>C.  <b>Supporting Idea</b>  There have been horrible reports and cases of discrimination at work in
                            terms of promotion and benefits. Hence, there is a need to create and implement a policy
                            related to this.</p>

                        </li>
                      </ol> <br>
                  </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <p><b>3. Problem-Cause-Solution</b></p>
                  <p>Below are the rules in applying this pattern.</p>
                  <p>1. Identify the problem.</p>
                  <p>2. Analyze the root causes of the problem.</p>
                  <p>3. Provide a solution to the problem.</p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">
                      <p>A. <b>Purpose</b> Persuade listeners why the state or government needs to converge with the
                        private sector in maintaining and protecting national heritage sites.</p>
                      <p>B. <b>Main Point</b> Preserving our national heritage sites such as century-old churches, theaters,
                        and other artifacts is the least priority of the government, so they should tie-up with
                        private establishments to maintain these historical places.</p>   
                    </li>
                  </ol><br>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <p><b>4. Comparative Advantages</b></p>
                  <p>Below are the rules in applying this pattern.</p>
                  <p> 1. Identify the problem.</p>
                  <p> 2. Present at least two solutions to the problem.</p>
                  <p> 3. Compare the two in terms of practicality and feasibility.</p>
                  <p> For example:</p>

                    speeches based on the psychology of persuasion (Ehninger, Monroe, & Granbeck, 1978).
                    This outline is known as Monroe’s Motivated Sequence.</p>

                      <p>Here’s how to apply this technique.</p>
                      <p>1. Grab the attention of the audience by identifying the challenge you plan to confront,

                      <p>2. Establish the need or urgency to address the identified challenge or problem.</p>

                <h2>Methods of Persuasion</h2>
                <p>Consider what Lucas (2011) writes about how the audience can be persuaded by a speaker. The
                  audience can be persuaded by the following reasons.</p>
                <p> &bull; They perceive that the speaker has credibility.</p>
                <p> &bull; They are convinced by the evidence presented by the speaker.</p>
                <p> &bull; They are convinced by the speaker’s reasoning.</p>
                <p> &bull; Their emotions are touched by the speaker’s ideas or use of language.</p>

                <p>The above ideas highlight some of the methods you can use in your persuasive speech. These
                  methods are commonly used and proven to be effective by any prominent and excellent speaker
                  across the globe. The follb owing are some tips on how to enhance your credibility, how to use
                  evidence, how to use reasoning, and how to observe ethics and emotional appeal in a persuasive
                  speech.</p>

                        <p><b>1. How to enhance your credibility</b></p>
                        <ol class="ol">
                          <p><b>A. Explain how you became an expert on the topic.</b></p>
                          <p>You can do this by sharing how well you read, investigated, or researched the topic.
                            For example: You could share that in the beginning you did not know much about your
                            topic until you researched about it. By saying you researched on your topic, your audience
                            will feel that you made an effort in building your credibility by collecting information.</p> <br>

                          <p><b>B. Connect your experiences, beliefs, values or attitudes with your audience’s.</b></p>
                          <p>You can do this by telling your audience that you have the same experiences, beliefs,
                            values or attitudes.</p> 
                            <p>For example: In the beginning of your speech, you can emphasize to your audience that
                              regardless of background, status, age, gender, beliefs, and values, among others, you all
                              have one thing in common and then add that which you have in common. By saying this,
                              your audience will feel respected and comfortable because you can identify with their
                              experiences, beliefs, or values.</p><br>

                          <p><b>C. Practice more often so you can deliver your speech with conviction.</b></p>
                          <p>You can do this by exposing yourself more often to speaking situations such as reciting
                            and reading announcements in class, introducing people in a program, hosting events,
                            participating in debates, or acting as a spokesperson of a group. Also, simply practicing
                            more often before your actual speech performance will increase your confidence and
                            help you deliver your speech with conviction.</p> <br>

                        </ol>

                        <p><b>2. How to use evidence</b></p>
                        <ol class="ol"> 
                          <li class="li">
                            <p><b>A. Specify evidence.</b></p>
                            <p>You can do this by citing statistics, research studies, and other valid and credible
                              information.</p>
                            <p>For example: When stating a fact, do not simply say a general detail. Instead of saying,
                              “There is a law that protects women and their children against violence,” state the exact
                              details, as in, “RA 9262 is an act that protects women and their children against violence.”
                              By specifying your evidence, you give the impression that you know what you are saying.</p><br>
                            
                            <p><b>B. Avoid outdated evidence.</b></p>
                            <p>You can do this by reading and digging new evidence to keep yourself updated on the
                              significant facts and figures.</p>
                            <p>For example: If you are arguing about social networking site addiction and you are
                              using data taken from 2000 or earlier, your speech might not hold enough credibility
                              and it might not retain the interest of your audience as well. Since we are now in the
                              Information Age, data quickly get old and replaced by more current ones, so they quickly
                              become irrelevant. Therefore, always make sure to use current available data. This way,
                              your speech will be more accurate and your audiences will be more interested to listen.</p><br>

                            <p><b>C. Choose reputable or credible sources for your evidence.</b></p>
                            <p>You can do this by carefully identifying and evaluating your sources.</p>
                            <p>For example: You are persuading your audience that your solution in improving the
                              interest of readers in Philippine literature is the most efficient method, but you cite
                              sources such as fan sites, Wiki answers, Yahoo answers, or blogs. This creates a bad
                              impression, as it might come off that your arguments and points are based on unreliable
                              facts. As a guide, Google, Yahoo, or any search engine can provide you a wealth of
                              reputable or credible sources for your evidence.</p><br>

                        <p><i>Avoid logical fallacies or errors in reasoning.</i></p>
                        <p>You can do this by studying the types of logical fallacies. The following are some of the
                          most common errors in reasoning.</p>

                            <p><b>Ad Hominem</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when you attack the character of a person instead of
                              his argument.</p>
                              <p>Example: Professor X does not deserve to be the head of this organization because he
                                is separated from his wife.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: When you give your rebuttal, focus on the arguments of the person,
                              not on his/her character or values.</p><br>
                            
                            <p><b>Circular Argument</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when the idea of a stated argument is repeated.</p>
                            <p>Example: My mother is a good teacher because she teaches me well.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: Do not repeat the argument; instead, prove it.</p><br>

                            <p><b>False Analogy</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when two things, which might be alike in some
                              respects, are compared and assumed to be similar in other ways.</p>
                              <p>Example: President Aquino is the Socrates of the 21st century.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: Look at the characteristics, features, or components of two people or
                              objects closely to see whether they can really be compared or not.</p><br>

                            <p><b>False Authority</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when a statement of someone who is not an expert
                              in the field in question is being used in an argument.</p>
                            <p>Example: I avoid drinking coffee at night because of the advice of my English teacher.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: Check properly the qualifications of the person being cited.</p><br>

                            <p>This happens when the connection between two consecutive
                              events are not clear.</p>
                            <p>Example: Because I attended a party, I got a high grade in my persuasive speech.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: Clarify the connections between the events by explaining both
                              backgrounds clearly.</p><br>

                            <p><b>Hasty Generalization</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient
                              evidence.</p>
                            <p>Example: The senator stuttered while giving his speech, therefore government
                              officials are not good in public speaking.</p>
                            <p>How to avoid: Provide enough pieces of evidence before making any conclusions.</p><br>

                            <p><b>Red Herring</b></p>
                            <p>This happens when the answer does not address the question.</p>
                            <p>Example: Question: Should the President sign Cyberbullying bill into law? Answer:
                              The President has other priorities.</p>

                            <p><b>A. Internalize what you are saying</b></p>
                            <p>The audience will be more convinced of your message if you also show conviction in
                              what you are saying.</p>
                            <p>For example: If you use emotionally charged words, but you deliver it in a monotonous
                              voice, the audience will not see the sincerity of your message. Instead, make sure to
                              observe your non-verbal cues and to ensure that you believe in what you are saying.</p><br>
                            
                            <p><b>B. Use emotion appropriately.</b></p>
                            <p>Although a well-executed emotional appeal can be used as a strong weapon in persuasive
                              speech, take note to use it only when appropriate to the message. Use it as an accessory
                              only; make sure not to replace evidence and reasoning with pure emotion.</p>
                            <p>For example: If you are making a speech on a question of fact, there is little need to use
                              emotional appeal to your audience since you are dealing with facts and information.
                              However, if you are making a persuasive speech to change a certain policy, you can add
                              emotional appeal to your speech to capture not only the minds but also the hearts of
                              your audience.</p><br>
