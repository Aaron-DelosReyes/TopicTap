          <h1>Roles and Functions of Media in a Democratic Society</h1> <hr>
          <p>During the Colonial Period, people had been restricted to express their ideas
            and fight for their rights. Democratic comes from the Greek words “demo” (people
            and “kratos” (rule) which means rule of the people. In democratic society, the welfare
            of the public is important and their rights are protected by the government.</p> <br>
            <p>The Philippines’ 1986 and 2001 People Power Revolutions perfectly show the
              importance of the role of media in today’s society. Prior to People Power 1, local
              newspapers such as The Manila Times, Daily Mirror and The Manila Chronicles have
              reported about the pervasive protests of people against the government because of
              its inability to respond to issues regarding labor, poverty and education. As a result,
              in September 21, 1972, President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law in hope
              of restoring the peace and order in the country. Instead, this dictatorial government
              had taken over the mass media. Some editors and journalists were arrested and
              detained to control the dissemination of negative news against the government,
              particularly the president.</p><br>
            <p>During the People Power II on 2001, the tenure of President Joseph Estrada.
              Media reported about his involvement in illegal gambling and adultery. Impeachment
              trial where the President Estrada was accused of plunder, betrayal of public trust,
              and culpable violation of the Constitution as cited in Article XI. When the second
              envelop, which allegedly contained incriminating evidences against President, was
              not opened based on the senators’ majority vote, the prosecutors walked out. Also,
              the people who were watching it since the first day of the senators’ majority vote, the
              prosecutors walked out. With the growing number of people encamped in EDSA and
              the majority of President Estrada’s cabinet members leaving their posts, the
              President had no choice but to step down from office.</p><br>
            <p>This proves that in democratic society, the media’s role is very crucial as it
              becomes a reliable source of information. People in democratic society also use
              different media platforms as a means to express their opinion on social issues. With
              the massive each of media, it can greatly influence people’s views and actions.</p><br>
            <p>Media, whether traditional or new, has a role to play in the proper functioning
              of a democratic society such as the Philippines. In order for a democratic society to
              function in an ideal way, media and communication must fulfill its mandate.
              According to McNair, communication and media function to:</p><br>

                <li> 
                  <p> A. Inform citizens of what is happening around them (also called the monitoring
                    function);</p>
                  <p> B. Educate the audience as to the meaning and significance of the “facts”;</p>
                  <p> C. Provide a platform for public political discourse, facilitating the formation of
                    “public opinion” and feeding that opinion back to the public from whence it
                    came, the provision of space for the expression of dissent;</p>
                  <p> D. Give publicity to government and political institutions, (known as the
                    “watchdog” role of journalism);</p>
                  <p> E. Serve as a channel for the advocacy of political viewpoints.</p>
