      <h1>PERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS</h1>  
      <hr>
      <p>Personal effectiveness means making use of all the personal resources –
        talents, skills, energy and time, to enable you to achieve life goals.
        Your knowledge of yourself and how you manage yourself impacts directly on
        your personal effectiveness. Being self-aware, making the most of your strengths,
        learning new skills and techniques and behavioral flexibility are all keys to improving
        your personal performance.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Our personal effectiveness depends on our innate characteristics – talent and
            experience accumulated in the process of personal development. Talents first are
            needed to be identified and then developed to be used in a particular subject area
            (science, literature, sports, politics, etc.).
            Experience includes knowledge and skills that we acquire in the process of
            cognitive and practical activities.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Knowledge is required for setting goals, defining an action plan to achieve
            them and risk assessment.
            Skills also determine whether real actions are performed in accordance with
            the plan. If the same ability is used many times in the same situation, then it
            becomes a habit that runs automatically, subconsciously. </p>
            <hr>
        <p>Here are some skills that
            will greatly increase the efficiency of any person who owns them:</p>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                    <h4>1. Determination</h4>
                    <p>It allows you to focus only on achieving a specific goal
                        without being distracted by less important things or spontaneous desires. It
                        may be developed with the help of self-discipline exercise.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>2. Self-Confidence</h4>
                    <p>It appears in the process of personal development, as a
                        result of getting aware of yourself, your actions and their consequences. Self-
                        confidence is manifested in speech, appearance, dressing, gait, and physical
                        condition. To develop it, you need to learn yourself and your capabilities, gain
                        positive attitude and believe that by performing right actions and achieving
                        right goals you will certainly reach success.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>3. Persistence</h4>
                    <p>It makes you keep moving forward regardless of emerging
                        obstacles – problems, laziness, bad emotional state, etc. It reduces the costs
                        of overcoming obstacles. It can also be developed with the help of self-
                        discipline exercise.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>4. Managing Stress</h4>
                    <p>It helps combat stress that arises in daily life from the
                        environment and other people. Stress arises from the uncertainty in an
                        unknown situation when a lack of information creates the risk of negative
                        consequences of your actions. It increases efficiency in the actively changing
                        environment.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>5. Problem-Solving Skills</h4>
                    <p>They help cope with the problems encountered with
                        a lack of experience. It increases efficiency by adopting new ways of
                        achieving goals when obtaining a new experience.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>6. Creativity</h4>
                    <p>It allows you to find extraordinary ways to carry out a specific
                        action that no one has tried to use. It can lead to a decrease or an increase of
                        costs, but usually the speed of action is greatly increased when using
                        creative tools.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h4>7. Generating Ideas</h4>
                    <p>It helps you achieve goals using new, original,
                        unconventional ideas. Idea is a mental image of an object formed by the
                        human mind, which can be changed before being implemented in the real
                        world. For generating ideas you can use a method of mental maps, which
                        allows you to materialize, visualize and scrutinize all your ideas, which in turn
                        contributes to the emergence of new ideas. These are just some, but the
                        most important personal effectiveness skills which make the achievement of
                        any goal easier and less costly.</p>
