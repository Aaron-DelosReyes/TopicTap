            <h1>THE STORY OF THE TWO WOLVES</h1>
            <hr>
           <p>The following is an
            old Cherokee Indian story
            that is enlightening a  nd
            helpful.</p> <hr>
            <p>One evening an old
                Cherokee told his grandson
                about a battle that goes on
                inside people. He said, "My
                son, the battle is between
                two wolves inside us all." <br> 
                "It is a terrible fight
                and it is between two
                wolves. One is evil - he is
                anger, envy, sorrow, regret,  
                greed, arrogance, self-pity,
                guilt, resentment, inferiority,
                lies, false pride, superiority,
                and ego." <br> He continued,
                "The other is good - he is
                joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy,
                generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you - and
                inside every other person, too." <br>
                The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather,
                <b>                "Which wolf will win?"
                </b>
                The old Cherokee simply replied, "The one you feed".</p>
                <hr>
                <p>                <b>Knowing which wolf to feed is the first step towards recognizing you have
                    control over your own self.</b></p>

                <p> Have you ever had thoughts, feelings or acted in ways that were
                    unacceptable to yourself but felt powerless to control? The purpose of this story is to
                    help you find ways to manage your mind so that you can live your life more in
                    accordance with what your own judgment says is best for you.</p>
                <p>
                    As we grow up, we gradually become aware of the many things in the
                    external world which are largely beyond our ability to control. These include other
                    people in general and most events in our lives. Initially this is difficult to accept, but a
                    more shocking realization is that there are many things about ourselves that we
                    seem powerless to control.</p>
                <p>Some of these are our own thoughts, feelings, and actions which
                    unfortunately can be the source of much distress. It may be thoughts such as “I
                    cannot stop hating my teacher for not giving me high grades.” It may involve an
                    emotion e.g. “My girlfriend left me and I cannot stop feeling sad, lonely and unloved.”</p> <hr>
               
                 <p>But are we indeed really powerless to control our own maladaptive thoughts,
                  feelings and actions? The grandfather’s answer "The one you feed" is deceivingly
                  simple. The results of psychological research indicate that there are at least four
                  important concepts or ideas implied by the answer:</p>
               
                  <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">
                      <p>1. The mind is not the unitary entity it seems to us but consists of different parts.
                        For example in the story there are the two wolves and the “you” that chooses
                        between them.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                      <p>2. These parts of the mind/brain can interact and be in conflict with each other
                        i.e. the two wolves fight for dominance over our mind and behavior.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                      <p>3. The “you” has the ability to decide which wolf it will feed.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                      <p>4. Having made a choice, “you” can decide specifically how to “feed” or nurture
                        the selected wolf</p>
                    </li>
                    
                  </ol>
