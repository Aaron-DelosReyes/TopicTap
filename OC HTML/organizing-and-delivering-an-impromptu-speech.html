          <h1>Organizing and Delivering an Impromptu Speech</h1>
          <hr>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p>Impromptu speeches are delivered with little or no time for preparation. In most instances,
            you are called to speak at the spur of the moment because you are expected to be knowledgeable
            about the subject.</p>
          <p>For example, your teacher assigned you to read an article before the class starts. Then, during
            the class you were asked to deliver an impromptu speech about what you have learned from the
            article. Another instance to illustrate an impromptu situation is when you are asked by a friend or
            a relative about your current or planned vacation trip or when you are campaigning for a position
            in school and you are asked by your fellow students to respond to their questions.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Strategies in Organizing and Delivering an Impromptu Speech</h2>
            <p>Below are some of the strategies that you can follow when you organize and deliver an
              impromptu speech.</p>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <b>1. Past, Present, Future</b>
                  <p>Example: In the <b>past</b>, I was not comfortable in making impromptu speeches because I could
                    not think right away of what to say; maybe it was because of nervousness and lack of time
                    to prepare. At <b>present</b>, however, I am enjoying it because I constantly practice and keep on
                    exposing myself to any speaking situation. In the <b>future</b>, I look forward to teaching others
                    how to survive impromptu speech situations. </p><br>

                      Facebook, I learn about the current events in the country—a fact which has a
                      bearing on my role as a citizen of this nation.</p></td>

                        happens and it is inevitable. Distinguished Toastmaster Craig Harrison (2010) shares the

                              reframe it as a topic you’d like to respond to. Redefine the topic as you believe it should
                              be, or at least the way you’d like it to be. Keep the structure but alter the subject. Rephrase
                              the question or even challenge it; you can even argue why the question given is not the
                              right question at all.</p>

              <td>
                <p>1. Smile.</p>
                <p>2. Relax by thinking about positive things. Keep telling yourself, “I am a
                  brilliant speaker. I will nail this presentation.”</p>
                <p>3. Identify your purpose. Is it to inform, to entertain, to welcome, to
                  congratulate, to apologize, or to give birthday greetings?</p>
                <p>4. Think of one big word that can serve as your main point. If you think you
                  have enough, think of the rule of three.</p>
                <p>Start outlining in your head. Focus on what to say first. Be reminded that
                  your first few words are crucial, so make them strong, powerful and catchy.</p>

                <p>1. When you are called, keep composed. Walk slowly to the lectern or the
                  center stage.</p>
                <p>2. Shake hands with the one who introduced you, if necessary.</p>
                <p>3. As you stand to deliver, establish eye contact, and begin right away with
                  your opening statements. Part of your opening is greeting your audience.</p>
                <p>4. From your initial idea to the next, use appropriate transitional devices.</p>
                <p>5. Observe appropriate and effective nonverbal cues.</p>
                <p>6. Observe time limit. Remember, you barely have five minutes to say
                  something.</p>
