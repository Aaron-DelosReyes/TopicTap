          <h2>Tools for Effective Speech Delivery</h2>
          <p>To be effective in your delivery, watch and emulate people who speak in public excellently. While
            observing, take note of the following:</p>
          <ul class="ul">
            <ol class="ol">
              <p> &bull; How they approach their audience (formal, informal, personal, conversational, intimate, among
                others).</p>
              <p> &bull; How they connect with their audience (using eye contact, body movements, and facial expressions).</p>
              <p> &bull; How they present themselves (stage presence: how they look, stand, walk, use nonverbal cues, act
                on and off the stage).</p>
              <p> &bull; How they use their voice in terms of volume (loudness or softness), pitch (highness or lowness),
                rate or speed, pauses to show emphasis and strengthen the clarity of the message, vocal variety
                (effective changes in volume, pitch, rate and pauses), and pronunciation.</p>

            </ol>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The items enumerated are the tools that can help you develop your speech. Practice in front of a
            mirror and observe your own delivery with these tools in mind. Alternatively, you can practice in front
            of your family, friends, classmates, or those who have already done public speaking. You can ask for
            feedback or seek advice from them. Explore which tools work best for you and develop a habit of effective
            delivery to enhance your public speaking skill. Keep practicing and engaging yourself in speaking
            situations. Remember, you already have the public speaking skill, but you will only improve if you speak
            in public constantly.</p> <hr>

            <h2>More Tips for Effective Speech Delivery</h2>
            <p>Following are more techniques and tips to help you deliver your speech well:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
              <ol class="ol">
                <p> 1. Use a conversational style more often. This is the style that is more natural; it is the style that you
                  always use when you express yourself with your family and friends. Audience members do not
                  like the speaker to sound unnatural or exaggerated.</p>
                <p> 2. Look your audience members in the eye so they will feel that they are part of your speech. Eye
                  contact should be maintained to keep the attention of your audience and enhance your delivery.</p>
                <p> 3. Remember to adjust your volume to the size of the audience and the venue. When addressing a
                  large audience, modulate your voice in such a way that you speak loudly without sounding like
                  shouting or yelling.</p>
                <p> 4. Vary your rate or speed to keep your audience interested and to avoid a monotone pattern. The
                  audience might get bored if you speak very slowly and they might get confused if you speak very
                  fast. Hence, your rate should be at an appropriate speed.</p>
                <p> 5. Master your voice and find your pitch level (high or low). If you have a high pitch level, modulate
                  or slightly move it down. If you have a low pitch level, modulate or slightly move it up. Your
                  performance will definitely be affected if you do not modulate.</p>
                <p> 6. Use pauses when you emphasize the most important words, phrases, or sentences. Your pauses
                  should not last for three seconds. Otherwise, it will result in dead air or a moment of awkward
                  silence.</p>
                <p> 7. Pronounce and enunciate words correctly. You will confuse the audience if you mispronounce
                  words, and it could distract them and affect your credibility.</p>
                <p> 8. Avoid fillers or expressions that substitute actual words in your speech because these words are
                  distracting. Examples of fillers are “like,” “um,” “ah,” “uh,” and “er.” To reduce the use of these
                  fillers, detect the instances when you use them: Do you generally use fillers after each sentence,
                  between different ideas, or whenever you make transitions? Then, instead of using them the next
                  time you deliver a speech, simply stop and pause.</p>
                <p> 9. Start your speech by standing straight and balancing your weight. This will give a positive first
                  impression.</p>
                <p> 10. Use precise movements. Avoid distracting mannerisms like swaying back and forth, leaning
                  on the podium, licking or biting your lips, playing with your wristwatch or jewelry, scratching
                  parts of your body, frowning, and others. Observe your mannerisms and learn how to avoid
                  them when speaking in public.</p>
                <p> 11. Avoid having a poker face or a highly animated face. These facial expressions appear distracting
                  and may even be annoying. Instead, follow the most highly suggested tip: smile. However, make sure that the meaning of your speech reflects in your facial expressions; do not smile if
                  you are talking about something sad.</p>
                <p> 12. Dress properly and appropriately. Wearing the proper attire will make you look more confident
                  and professional. Make sure not to overdress, as this may distract your audience.</p>
                <p> 13. Observe ethics by coming prepared, being honest with your words, being polite, avoiding
                  offensive words and back-biting or talking negative things about other people, or copying
                  someone’s work without proper documentation.</p>
                <p> 14. Breathe in and out to relax before your speech. Most importantly, have fun.</p>
