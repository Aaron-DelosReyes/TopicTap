          <h1>FEATURES OF CIVILIZATION</h1>

            <hr>
          <p>PERRY (1993) states that historians use the term civilization to distinguish between pre-historic societies to more advanced societies.</p>
          <hr>
          <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">
              <h2>1. Cities</h2>
              <p>Civilization describes a complex way of life that came about as people began to develop networks of urban settlements. Civilized
                societies were urban societies; it is larger and complex than villages. They had palaces, temples, markets, workshops, and homes. Before
                they could emerge, there must be a surplus in food supplies produced by the villagers.</p> <br>

            </li>
            <hr>
            <li class="li">
              <h2>2. Writings</h2>
              <p>Written language in particular allows civilizations to record their own history and everyday eventsâ€”crucial for
                understanding ancient cultures. It allows people to preserve, organized, and expands their knowledge. It made also the officials do their
                job easier.</p> <br>
              <p>The world's oldest known written language is Sumerian, which developed in Mesopotamia around 3100 BCE. The most familiar form
                of early Sumerian writing was called cuneiform and was made up of different collections of wedge (triangle) shapes. The earliest
                Sumerian writing was record-keeping. Just like written records of modern civilizations, Sumerian cuneiform kept track
                of taxes, grocery bills, and laws for things like theft.</p> <br>
              <p>The most familiar platform of shared communication is probably written language. One of the first written languages was Sumerian
                cuneiform, made up of triangle shapes.</p> <br> <hr>
            </li>

            <li class="li">
              <h2>3. Specialization</h2>
              <p>Civilizations are marked by complex divisions of labor. This means that different people perform specialized tasks. In a purely
                agricultural society, members of the community are largely self-sufficient and can provide food, shelter, and clothing for themselves. In a
                complex civilization, farmers may cultivate one type of crop and depend on other people for other foods, clothing, shelter, and
                information. Civilizations that depend on trade are specially marked by divisions of labor</p> <br>
                <hr>
            </li>

            <li class="li">
              <h2>4. Government</h2>
              <p>All civilizations rely on government administration. An organized way of making and enforcing decisions. It maintains order in a
                society. The government also collects taxes to fund different projects such as roads, irrigation works, palaces, temples, and bridges. The
                government drew up boundary lines to protect its people and territory, and form its army to protect and expand its borders.</p> <br>
                <hr>
            </li>

            <li class="li">
              <h2>5. Religion</h2>
              <p>Civilized societies had organized religion, with the powerful, trained, and wealthy priesthood. From the priesthood, people derive
                their beliefs and values towards life. Religion gives rulers the authority for they were thought to represent the will of God. To the ancient
                people, religion is something to help them understand/provide meaning to life.</p> <br>
