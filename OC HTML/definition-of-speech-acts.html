            <h1>Definition of Speech Acts</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>A speech act is an utterance that a speaker makes to achieve an intended effect. Some of
                the functions which are carried out using speech acts are offering an apology, greeting, request,
                complaint, invitation, compliment, or refusal. A speech act might contain just one word or several
                words or sentences. For example, “Thanks” and “Thank you for always being there for me. I really
                appreciate it” both show appreciation regardless of the length of the statement.</p>
<hr>
            <h2>Three Types of Speech Act</h2>
            <p>According to J. L. Austin (1962), a philosopher of language and the developer of the Speech Act
                Theory, there are three types of acts in every utterance, given the right circumstances or context.
                These are:</p>

            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                    <h3>1. Locutionary act</h3>
                    <p> Is the actual act of uttering.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td> <p> “Please do the dishes.”</p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h3>2. Illocutionary act</h3>
                    <p> Is the social function of what is said.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td> <p>"By uttering the locution “Please do the dishes,” the speaker requests the
                                    addressee to wash the dishes."</p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <h3>3. Perlocutionary act</h3>
                    <p> Is the resulting act of what is said. This effect is based on the particular
                        context in which the speech act was mentioned.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td> <p> "Please do the dishes” would lead to the addressee washing the dishes.</p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </li>

            </ol>
<hr>

<p>There are also indirect speech acts which occur when there is no direct connection between the
    form of the utterance and the intended meaning. They are different in force (i.e., intention) from
    the inferred speech act.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, read the following utterance.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>"Can you pass the rice?”</i></p><br>
    <p>Inferred speech act: Do you have the ability to hand over the rice?
        Indirect speech act: Please pass the rice.</p> <br>
        <p>Inferred speech act: Do you have the ability to hand over the rice?
            Indirect speech act: Please pass the rice.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Performatives</h2>
<p>Austin also introduced the concept of performative utterances: statements which enable the
    speaker to perform something just by stating it. In this manner, verbs that execute the speech act
    that they intend to effect are called performatives. A performative utterance said by the right person
    under the right circumstances results in a change in the world. Note that certain conditions have to
    be met when making a performative utterance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, the phrase “I now pronounce you
        husband and wife,” when uttered by an authorized
        person such as a judge will have the actual effect of
        binding a couple in marriage. However, if the same
        statement is uttered to the same couple in the same
        place by someone who is not authorized to marry
        them—as in the case of the accompanying picture, a
        robot—then there is no effect whatsoever because a
        condition was not met.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Searle’s Classifications of Speech Act</h2>
<p>As a response to Austin’s Speech Act Theory, John Searle (1976), a professor from the University
    of California, Berkeley, classified illocutionary acts into five distinct categories.</p>

    <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">
            <h3>1. Assertive</h3>
            <p> A type of illocutionary act in which the speaker expresses belief about the truth of
                a proposition. Some examples of an assertive act are suggesting, putting forward, swearing,
                boasting, and concluding.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <p>Example: </p>
                             <p><i>No one makes better pancakes than I do.</i> </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

        <li class="li">
            <h3>2. Directive</h3>
            <p> A type of illocutionary act in which the speaker tries to make the addressee
                perform an action. Some examples of a directive act are asking, ordering, requesting,
                inviting, advising, and begging.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <p>Example: </p>
                             <p><i>Please close the door.</i> </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

        <li class="li">
            <h3>3. Commissive</h3>
            <p>  A type of illocutionary act which commits the speaker to doing something in
                the future. Examples of a commissive act are promising, planning, vowing, and betting.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <p>Example: </p>
                             <p><i>From now on, I will participate in our group activity.</i></p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

        <li class="li">
            <h3>4. Expressive</h3>
            <p> A type of illocutionary act in which the speaker expresses his/her feelings
                or emotional reactions. Some examples of an expressive act are thanking, apologizing,
                welcoming, and deploring.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <p> Example:</p>
                             <p> <i>I am so sorry for not helping out in our group projects and letting you do all the work.</i></p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

        <li class="li">
            <h3>5. Declaration</h3>
            <p> A type of illocutionary act which brings a change in the external situation.
                Simply put, declarations bring into existence or cause the state of affairs which they refer to.
                Some examples of declarations are blessing, firing, baptizing, bidding, passing a sentence,
                and excommunicating.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td> <p>Example: </p>
                             <p><i>You are fired!</i> </p>
                             <p>By saying that someone is fired, an employer causes or brings about the person’s
                                unemployment, thus changing his external situation. </p>

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </li>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>Always keep in mind that speech acts include concrete life interactions that require the
    appropriate use of language within a given culture. Communicative competence (i.e., the ability
    to use linguistic knowledge to effectively communicate with others) is essential for a speaker to be
    able to use and understand speech acts. Idioms and other nuances in a certain language might be
    lost or misunderstood by someone who does not fully grasp the language yet.</p>
