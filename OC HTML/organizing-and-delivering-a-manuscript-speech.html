          <h1>Organizing and Delivering a Manuscript Speech</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p>When speaking from a manuscript, you write and deliver a speech word for word. The question
            is, for whom is the manuscript method most advantageous?</p>
            <ul class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <b>1. Public Figures</b>
                <p>Since public figures are always constrained by a hectic schedule, they need
                  ghost writers. Consequently, they would have to read the text of the speech as it is. The
                  President’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) is a concrete example of this situation.</p> <br>
                <b>2. Media Personalities</b>
                <p>Speakers on radio and television always battle with time limits. For
                  example, a televised panel discussion about a social issue may require radio and TV anchors
                  to critically choose and refine the words of their speech in advance.</p> <br>
                <b>3. Spokespersons for Government and Private Organizations</b>
                <p>This public speaking role requires
                  a great deal of contemplation and preparation. For example, we have speeches of different
                  country’s spokespersons in an international seminar on climate change.</p> <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Potential Problems with the Manuscript Method</h2>
            <ol class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <p>1. Since this type of speech follows a word-for-word method, you might be tempted to skip practicing
                  the speech.</p><br>
                <p>2. In relation to the previous point, if you fail to practice your speech and decide to read it during
                  the time of delivery itself, you might be glued to the speech all throughout. You may overlook
                  making eye contact with your audience. Note that glancing at the audience only at the end of a
                  sentence is not sufficient to establish and maintain rapport during the speech.</p><br>
                <p>3. Lastly, because everything is planned based on the time allotted, you will surely want to cover
                  everything in your speech before you run out of time. This might affect your connection with the
                  audience, as there is a tendency to ignore the audience and neglect responding to their feedback
                  when busy with the speech. Pay attention and make sure to check and adjust if the audience
                  displays anxiety, impatience, or boredom.</p><br>

            <h2>Strategies in Organizing and Delivering the Manuscript Speech</h2>
            <ol class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <b>1. Practice!</b>
                <p>Practice delivering the speech several times. Mark the text. Even if it’s a manuscript, know
                  the speech by heart. Only if you do these can you keep frequent eye contact with the audience.</p><br>

                <b>2. Adapt!</b>
                <p>Even if you have a manuscript, feel free to modify the text when the situation demands it.
                  If you observe that your audience is bored, you may use shorter yet more vigorous words. If your
                  audience is impatient, add words of strong motivational power. If your audience is anxious, share
                  personal anecdotes to lighten the mood.</p><br>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips in Using the Manuscript Method</h2>
            <ol class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <b>1. Prepare</b>
                <p>Keep your text easy to use by neatly composing it in triple space.</p><br>

                <b>2. Mark</b>
                <p>Own your manuscript by highlighting key words and phrases. This way you will be guided
                  during the speech delivery.</p><br>

                <b>3. Practice</b>
                <p> You can make a lot of notes on the draft of your manuscript during the first few rehearsals,
                  but make sure to reprint your script, especially if you make too many changes.</p><br>

                <b>4. Practice some</b>
                <p> Read the text over and over orally. This will help you avoid mispronounced
                  words, faulty starts, and wrong pauses. As you practice, vary the volume, rate, and pitch of your
                  voice during appropriate points in the speech.</p><br>

                <b>5. Concentrate</b>
                <p>Concentrate on keeping eye contact, but do not stare at only one section of the
                  audience. It is best if you familiarize yourself with the most important parts of your speech. If you
                  do this, you will be more confident in looking at your audience during the key points of the speech.</p><br>

                <b>6. Act it out</b>
                <p>Use a lectern or a podium when practicing the speech. If you can find one before the
                  actual speech delivery, practice using it so that you will be used to laying your notes flat on the
                  podium and looking at them once in a while.</p><br>
