            <h1>SOCIAL CONTROL
            </h1><hr>

            <p>            Social control is the control that a society has over an individual or group of people's
                social norms and actions. Social control is divided into two subgroup categories, formal
                social sanctions and informal social sanctions. Formal social sanctions are ways that society
                prohibits any social deviance through rules and laws. These rules are usually carried out
                through police officers and court officials. Informal social sanctions are rules that are not
                spoken but known or assumed by a community. These rules become embedded within us to
                be used at a later time in our lives. (Conley, 2011) (Scott & Marshall, 2009) (Calhoun, 2002)</p>
