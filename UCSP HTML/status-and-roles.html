          <h1>STATUS AND ROLES</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>What is the other thing that comprises society?
              In expecting to have a harmonious relationship inside the society, status and role are two
              important elements.</p> <hr>
            <h2>STATUS</h2>
            <p>A part of a person’s social identity defines his/her relationship with others.
              (Macionis, 2006). Also refers to a person’s position inside a group in society.</p><br>
            <p>Also, status is the position of an individual in relation to another or others, especially in
              regard to social or professional standing. An individual can be addressed by his status,
              such as a father, governor, SHS student, a teacher, a vendor, and an online seller are some
              examples of a status.</p><br>
            <p>On the other hand, every person holds different statuses at the same time, such as being
              a father, a teacher, a cousin, a brother to his siblings, and a husband, and this is
              called STATUS SET.</p><br>
            <p>Moreover, status sets can change over the life course on a person, because a teenager
              who is a high school student, will turn into a college student, into a worker, and eventually
              turn into a family man, when a man marries to become a husband and wife changes are
              occurring through life stages.</p><br>
              <hr>
            <h2>Two different types of status:</h2>
            <ol class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <h3>ASCRIBED STATUS</h3>
                <p>A social position where a person receives at birth or takes
                  involuntarily later in life. It is also believed to be assigned to us by the group or society.</p><br>
                <p>An ascribed status, on the other hand, is beyond an individual's control. It is not earned,
                  but rather is something people are either born with or had no control over.</p><br>
                <p>Examples of ascribed status include sex, race, and age. Children usually have more
                  ascribed statuses than adults, since they do not usually have a choice in most matters.</p><br>

              </li>

              <li class="li">
                <h3>ACHIEVED STATUS</h3>
                <p>An achieved status is one that is acquired on the basis of merit; it
                  is a position that is earned or chosen and reflects a person's skills, abilities, and efforts.
                  Being a professional athlete, for example, is achieved status, as is being a lawyer, college
                  professor, or even a criminal.</p><br>
                <p>A family's social status or socioeconomic status, for instance, would be an achieved status
                  for adults, but an ascribed status for children.</p><br>
                <p>Homelessness might also be another example. For adults, homelessness often comes by
                  way of achieving, or rather not achieving, something. For children, however, homelessness
                  is not something they have any control over. Their economic status, or lack thereof, is
                  entirely dependent on their parents' actions.</p><br>
                  <hr>
                  <h3>MASTER STATUS</h3>
                <p>Lastly, there is so-called MASTER STATUS, to put it simply, is a key or core status that
                  carries primary weight in personal interaction and relationships with others. (Hughes and
                  Kroehler, 2009) A master status is the defining social position a person holds, meaning the
                  title the person most relates to when trying to express themselves to others. <br><br>
                  In sociology, it is a concept that lies at the core of a person's social identity and
                  influences that person's roles and behaviors in a societal context. <br><br>
                  Occupation is often a master status because it forms such an important part of a person's
                  identity and affects the other roles one may occupy such as a family member or friend, a
                  resident of a city, or even a hobby enthusiast. In this way, a person may identify as a
                  teacher, firefighter, or pilot, for example. <br><br>
                  Gender, age, and race are also common master statuses, where a person feels the
                  strongest allegiance to their core defining characteristics. <br><br>
                  Regardless of what master status a person identifies with, it is often largely due to
                  external social forces like socialization and social interaction with others which shape how
                  we see and understand ourselves and our relationships with others.</p><br>

              </li>
            </ol>
            <hr>

            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>Are a set of expectations for people who occupy a given social position or status.
            The role, in sociology, the behavior expected of an individual who occupies a given social
            position or status. A role is a comprehensive pattern of behavior that is socially recognized,
            providing a means of identifying and placing an individual in a society. It also serves as a
            strategy for coping with recurrent situations and dealing with the roles of others (e.g.,
            parent-child roles). <br> <br>
            A person that holds multiple statuses also holds multiple roles, a sociologist Robert
            Merton introduced the term ROLE SET to identify the number of roles attached to single
            status. <br> <br>
            This figure shows an example of having multiple statuses and roles.
            <br><br>
            The sociological significance of roles is that they lay out what is expected of people, like
            being a teacher, you are expected to teach and to be a good colleague, a student is expected
            to study well in school and a student is also a child that is expected to respect their parents
            and love their siblings. It allows us to formulate our behavior so that we can mentally shape
            our actions in an appropriate way.</p> <hr>
