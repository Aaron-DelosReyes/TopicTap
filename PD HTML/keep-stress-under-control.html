           <h1>Keep Stress Under Control</h1> <hr>

           <p>There are many effective ways to handle stress. Of course, you can’t avoid
            stress—in fact, you wouldn’t want to avoid all stress, because you’d never grow.
            However, you can manage your life so that you survive the emotional down times
            without allowing stress to engulf you. Also, you can work to eliminate controllable
            stress factors, such as running late or not getting enough sleep. But when stress is
            constant or too great, your wisest option is to find ways to reduce or control it. You
            need not, and should not, live your life in emotional stress and discomfort. Stress can
            be successfully managed. Here are some suggestions that may help.</p><hr>
          <h2>Understand the Causes of Stress</h2>
          <p>Understanding why you are under stress is important. This may seem
            obvious, but it requires deliberate, conscious effort to pause and simply ponder your
            situation. By now, you are familiar with the stress response, the emotional or
            physical symptoms of uncontrolled stress. Now you need to try to discover the
            stressors, the factors of which create the stress in your life.</p><hr>

            <h2>Analyze your Stress Factors and Write Them Down</h2>
            <p>Write down your response to stress. For example, you may write down, “I feel
              tired most of the time. My lower back seems to ache all through the day and night. I
              miss deadlines and run behind schedule.” Analyze stress responses and
              consequences, and consider each item, and ask why. “Why am I feeling tired? Why
              does my back ache? Why do I run behind schedule? Carefully consider each
              answer, because the answers will reveal stressors, such as deadlines, anxieties,
              trying to do so much, managing time or money poorly, or poor health habits.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Deal with the Stressors</h2>
            <p>Develop techniques to deal with the causes of stress. The longer you avoid
              dealing with the stress factors, the more the stress will build up. If tension comes
              because you have put off an unfinished task, restructure your priorities so you can
              get the task that you have been avoiding out of the way and off your mind.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Learn to Work under Pressure or Unusual Conditions</h2>
            <p>When you can’t reduce the stressors, you need to manage your stress
              response. Almost everyone, at least at some point, has to meet deadlines, keep
              several jobs going at once, resolve problems that come up, and do extra work when
              necessary. However, when the pressure mounts, you can relieve it. Relaxation is
              key—but most people must train themselves to relax when the pressure is on.</p>
              <p>Some tips to relax when under pressure are the following:</p>
            <ol class="ol">
              <li class="li">
                <p> &bull; Stop for a moment (especially when you feel your muscles tightening up) and
                  take a few deep breaths.</p>
                <p> &bull; Do a relaxing exercise. Swing your hands at your sides and stretch.</p>
                <p> &bull; Take a “power nap.” Lie down and totally relax for a few minutes.</p>
                <p> &bull; Find time to do the things you enjoy.</p>
                <p> &bull; Leave your study area for a while to take a brisk walk.</p>
                <p> &bull; Find a quiet place to read a magazine or novel during break or at lunch.</p>
                <p> &bull; If possible, look at some peaceful images such as forests, beaches, etc. These images can initiate a relaxation response.</p>
                <p> &bull; Look up.</p>
                <p> &bull; Keep something humorous on hand, such as a book of jokes.</p>
