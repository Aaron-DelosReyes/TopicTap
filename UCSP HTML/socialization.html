          <h1>LESSON II: SOCIALIZATION</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>SOCIALIZATION</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The process in which people learn the rules and practices needed to participate successfully in
              their culture and society.</p> <br> 
            <p>Socialization, the process whereby an individual learns to adjust to a group (or society) and
              behave in a manner approved by the group (or society). According to most social scientists,
              socialization essentially represents the whole process of learning throughout the life course and
              is a central influence on the behavior, beliefs, and actions of adults as well as of children.</p><br>
            <p>Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of
              society. It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations, to
              accept society’s beliefs, and to be aware of societal values. Socialization is not the same as
              socializing (interacting with others, like family, friends, and coworkers); to be precise, it is a
              sociological process that occurs through socializing</p><br>
            <p>A continuing process whereby an individual acquires a personal identity and learns the norms,
              values, behavior, and social skills appropriate to his or her social position.</p><br>
            <hr>
              <h2>Now, what is the difference between Enculturation and Socialization?</h2>
          
            <p>The main difference between socialization and enculturation is that socialization is basically
              the process of learning to behave in a way that is acceptable to society, whereas enculturation is
              the process of being socialized into a certain culture.</p><br>
            <p>Secondly, the difference between socialization and enculturation is that socialization is
              (sociology|psychology) the process of learning how to live in a way acceptable to one's own
              society, said especially about children while enculturation is the process by which an individual
              adopts the behavior patterns of the culture in which he or she is immersed.</p><br>
            <p>Socialization and enculturation are two similar processes. Socialization refers to the general
              process of acquiring culture, while enculturation specifically refers to the process of being
              socialized to a particular culture. In fact, it is not incorrect to say that enculturation is a product
              of socialization.</p><br>
            <p>In conclusion, the two are somehow similar, both are the process of acquiring and learning the
              different requirement or components of one’s culture to fully participate in the society that they
              belong to, the only difference is simply that, enculturation is used by the anthropologist to refer
              how and the individual learns about his or her culture, while socialization is a term commonly
              used by the sociologist to describe how and individual participates in the society.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <h2>What are the things that we can learn?</h2>
              <p>After learning about the process of enculturation and socialization, what are the things that an
                individual learns to adapt through this process?</p>
              <p>In the succeeding lesson for this module, we will learn about these things. Here is the list of
                things that they learn to adapt to form.</p>

            <h2> IDENTITY FORMATION</h2>
            <p>Through the process of socialization and enculturation, one’s identity is being formed, now
              what is so called identity formation?</p><br>
            <p>Identity formation has been most extensively described by Erik Erikson in his theory of
              developmental stages, which extends from birth through adulthood. According to Erikson,
              identity formation, while beginning in childhood, gains prominence during adolescence. Faced
              with physical growth, sexual maturation, and impending career choices, adolescents must
              accomplish the task of integrating their prior experiences and characteristics into a stable
              identity.</p><br>
            <p>Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity
              begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to ‘trying on’
              different behaviors and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity
              and discover who they are, adolescents are likely to cycle through a number of identities to find
              one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult
              task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status.</p><br>
              <hr>
            <h2> What is Identity? </h2>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <h3>IDENTITY</h3>
                  <p>Relates to the understandings people hold on and believe in what is meaningful to them as
                    it may be sourced of gender, sexual orientation, nationality or ethnicity, and social class.
                    Identity also refers to who a person is, or the qualities of a person or group that make
                    them different from others.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h3>SOCIAL IDENTITY</h3>
                  <p>It refers to the characteristics that other people attribute to an
                    individual. These are also called as markers to identify someone in society. A father, a student,
                    sibling, widow a teacher are some examples of social identity. Social identity is a person’s sense
                    of who they are based on their group membership(s).</p>
                </li>

                <li class="li">
                  <h3>SELF IDENTITY</h3>
                  <p>Or referred also as personal identity, it makes one a unique or distinct
                    individual. It refers also to the process of self-development through which an individual
                    formulates a unique sense of themselves and their relationship to the people or things around
                    him/her. Self-identity refers to stable and prominent aspects of one’s self-perception</p>
