        <h1>Relationship between Traditional Media and New Medias</h1> <hr>
        <p>In the present time, new media is undeniably very useful, but this does not
          mean that traditional media has already become obsolete. Traditional media is still
          valuable and influential because it has a wider reach and market. Examples the
          people whole live in remote areas and people opted to traditional media.</p>
        <p>The choice of media is based one’s needs, interests, and lifestyle as both
          traditional media and new media can carry out their purpose of keeping the people
          informed and helping everyone to stay connected.</p> <hr>
          <h2>The Traditional Media and New Media</h2>
          <p><b>Traditional Media</b></p>
          <p>&bull; It is one-directional</p> 
          <p>&bull; The media experience is limited</p> 
          <p>&bull; The sense of receptors used are
            very specific (i.e., print media
            requires sense of sight, radio
            requires sense of hearing, and
            television and film requires both)</p> 

          <p><b>New Media</b></p>
          <p>&bull; The audiences are more involved</p> 
          <p>&bull; They are able to feedback
            simultaneously</p> 
          <p>&bull; Integrates all the aspects of the
            traditional media.</p> 
          <p>&bull; Media experience is more
            interactive</p> 
            <hr>
            <h2>Four Main Categories of New Media (according to McQuail)</h2>
            <p><b>A. Interpersonal communication media.</b></p>
            <p>Examples would be the telephone,
              and e-mail where’’ content is private and perishable and the relationship
              established and reinforced may be more important than the information
              conveyed.’’</p> <br>

              <p><b>1. Interactive play media.</b></p>
              <p>Video and computer-based games, plus virtual
                reality devise compose this category.</p> <br>


              <p><b>2. Information search media.</b></p>
              <p>The Internet and the World Wide Web become
                repositories or sources of a vast collection of information that can be accessed
                real-time despite geographical location. Broadcast teletext and radio data
                services are also examples. Information retrieval is no longer limited to
                personal computers because this functionality has been extended to smartphones and tablets. Other means of information storage and retrieval include
                the personal video recorder, CD-ROM, compact disc, and DVD.</p> <br>

              
              <p><b>3. Collective participatory media.</b></p>
              <p>This refers to the to the use of the Internet
                for ‘’sharing and exchanging information, ideas, and experiences and
                developing active (computer-mediated) personal relationships active (McQuail,
                2010),</p> <br>

              <hr>
              <h2>Normative Theories of the Press</h2>
              <p><b>1. Authoritarian Theory</b></p>
              <p> it describes that all forms of communications are
                under the control of the governing elite or authorities or influential
                bureaucrats. Authoritarians are necessary to control the media to protect and
                prevent the people from the national threats through any form
                communication. The press is an instrument to enhance the ruler’s power in
                the country rather than any threats.</p> <br>

              
              <p><b>2. Soviet Media Theory</b></p>
              <p>The Soviet Union was restructured with new political
                system based on the Marxist-Leninist principles. The newly formed
                communist party by Lenin shows much interest in the media which serves to
                the working class in the country and their welfare. So the Soviet originates a
                theory from Marxist, Leninist and Stalinist thoughts, with mixture of Georg
                Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ideology is called “Soviet Media Theory” is also known
                as “The communist Media Theory”. The same theory was developed and
                followed by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy</p> <br>

              
              <p><b>3. Marxist Theory</b></p>
              <p>The basis which our analysis perspectives, programme, and
                participation in the movement are based. It is our “guide to action” and is why
                the international Marxist Tendency places so much emphasis on political
                education.</p> <br>

              <p><b>4. Marxist Theory and Leninist Theory</b></p>
              <p>The crimes we shall expose are to be
                judge not by the standards of Communist regimes, but by the unwritten code
                of the natural laws of humanity.</p> <br>

              <p><b>5. Stalinist Theory</b></p>
              <p>The method of rule, or policies of Joseph Stalin, Soviet
                Communist Party and state leader from 1929 until his death in 1954.
                Stalinism is associated with a regime of terror and totalitarian rule.</p> <br>

              <p><b>6. Libertarian Theory</b></p>
              <p>Sees people are more enough to find and judge good
                ideas from bad. The theory says people are rational and their rational thoughts
                lead them to find out what are good and bad. The press should not restrict
                anything even a negative content may give knowledge and can make better
                decision while in worst situation. The libertarian thoughts are exactly against
                or opposite to the authoritarian theory which means the authoritarian theory
                says “ all forms of communication works under the control of government or
                elite like king”.</p> <br>

              <p><b>7. Social Responsibility Theory </b></p>
              <p>– Allows free press without any censorship but
                at the same time the content of the press should be discussed in public panel
                and media should accept any obligation from public interference or
                professional self-regulations or both. The theory lies between both authoritarian theory and libertarian theory because it gives total media
                freedom in one hand but the external controls in other hand.</p> <br>

              <p><b>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</b></p>
              <p>a German Philosopher who developed a
                dialectical scheme that emphasized the progress of history and of ideas from
                thesis to antithesis and thence to a synthesis.</p> <br>
