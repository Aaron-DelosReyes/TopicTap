          <h1> Principles of Speech Delivery</h1> 
          <hr>
          <h2>Insights on Public Speaking</h2>
          <p>After listening to the speeches of the champions, you may have noticed that aside from the speech
            content, their delivery was also essential to their victory. The speakers seemed so natural and at ease that
            you wonder: Are effective speakers made, or are they naturally born effective speakers? It is true that
            some people are born with special gifts in public speaking, but it is also true that most of the best public
            speakers either underwent intensive formal training or got involved in several speaking situations that,
            over time, enabled them to hone the skill.</p>
            <p>According to Stephen Lucas (2011), author of The Art of Public Speaking, a good delivery means that
              you are capable and able to present your message in a clear, coherent, and interesting way. In addition to
              this, he also says:</p>
              <br>
              <table>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                <td><p>Good delivery…conveys the speaker’s ideas clearly, interestingly, and without distracting
                  the audience. Most audiences prefer delivery that combines a certain degree of formality with
                  the best attributes of good conversation—directness, spontaneity, animation, vocal and facial
                  expressiveness, and a lively sense of communication (p. 244).</p></td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>As a student of public speaking, you should know that public speaking is not simply reading your
                  speech or talking about your topic. It requires making connections with your audience and presenting
                  yourself formally to the public. There are types of speeches according to purpose and delivery from which
                  you can choose the best one or the most appropriate in a given situation.</p>
                  <hr>

                  <h2>Types of Speech According to Purpose</h2>
                  <p> <b>1. Informative Speech</b></p>
                  <p>An informative speech provides the audience with a clear understanding of a concept or idea. The
                    lectures of your teachers are the best examples of this type.</p>

                  <p> <b>2. Entertainment Speech</b></p>
                  <p>An entertainment speech amuses the audience. The humorous speeches of comedians and performers
                    are the best examples of this type.</p>

                  <p> <b>3. Persuasive Speech</b></p>
                  <p>A persuasive speech seeks to provide the audience with favorable or acceptable ideas that can
                    influence their own ideas and decisions. The campaign speeches of the running candidates for
                    government posts are the best examples of this type.</p>

                    <h2>Delivery for Different Situations</h2>
                    <p>Bear in mind that not all speaking situations happen in the classroom. Some may happen
                      in unfamiliar environments. To illustrate, you may run or be nominated for a school or local
                      government office, so a room-to-room and public campaign speech is required; or you may be
                      invited to welcome a visitor in your school or community, so an opening or welcoming remark is
                      necessary; or you may be asked to represent your school or community in a literary contest. These
                      are a few situations where your delivery skill will be simultaneously challenged and honed.</p>

                                    <p> &bull; Avoid gripping the edges of the podium with both hands. Aside from this,
                                      also avoid hiding them behind the podium.</p>
                                    <p> &bull; For extemporaneous and impromptu speakers, step to the side occasionally
                                      once you have composed yourself, so you can effectively use your gestures,
                                      make eye contact, and connect more with your audience.</p>
