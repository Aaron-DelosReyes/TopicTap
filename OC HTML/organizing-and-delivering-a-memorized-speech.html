          <h1>Organizing and Delivering a Memorized Speech</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p>A <b>memorized speech</b> requires you to commit the speech to memory so that you do not bring
            your notes when delivering it. As with the manuscript speech, you also run the risk of sounding
            mechanical during a memorized delivery. For this reason, keep your memorized speech short and
            work harder on your facial expressions and the tone of your voice.</p> <hr>

            <h2>When should you memorize?</h2>
            <p>Although keeping a speech in memory is needed only on very rare occasions, memorizing a
              speech can help you achieve a smooth and effortless delivery. You do not need to focus on notes
              or a manuscript. You can concentrate on maintaining eye contact with your audience, establishing
              rapport, and interacting with your audience.</p>
            <p>Since memorizing can be very tough and mechanical, it is best that you memorize short speeches
              for special occasions. A memorized speech works best for the introduction of a guest, acceptance of
              award or recognition, toast, eulogy, tribute, and the like.</p> <hr>

              <h2>Disadvantages of the Memorized Speech</h2>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <p>1. You might forget what you are supposed to say. Long pauses can create a very awkward moment
                    between you and your audience.</p><br>
                  <p>2. You might memorize the speech mechanically. This can result in a very unnatural delivery.</p><br>
                  <p>3. You might focus on content. Consequently, groping for the right words might make you look
                    uptight and stiff.</p><br>
                  <p>4. You might be too tied to remembering your script. This will give you no chance to pay attention
                    and respond to audience feedback.</p><br>

                </li>

              <h2>Advantages of Delivering a Memorized Speech</h2>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <p>1. You do not need notes anymore. Since the speech is memorized, you do not have to worry about
                    when to read and when to glance at your audience.</p><br>
                  <p>2. You can plan gestures, facial expressions, and movement. When you know the speech by heart,
                    it will be easier for you to work on nonverbal communication.</p><br>
                  <p>3. You can concentrate on visual aids and props. A memorized speech will help you focus more on
                    your props if you have any.</p><br>
                  <p>You will feel more confident. If you know that you have committed the speech to memory, you
                    will not be anxious about running out of words or not knowing what to say.</p><br>

              <h2>Tips in Memorizing a Speech</h2>
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">
                  <b>1. Break it down </b>
                  <p>You cannot memorize a speech in one sitting. If your speech has four paragraphs,
                    you should focus on one paragraph at a time. Once you have memorized the first paragraph,
                    focus on the next one. </p><br>
                  <b>2. Build it up </b>
                  <p> After memorizing the speech in snippets, you need to put them together. Recite the
                    first paragraph and move on to the second. After this, recite the first and second paragraphs and
                    move on to the third. The next thing you know, you have completed your speech.</p><br>
                  <b>3. Speak out </b>
                  <p> Do not memorize the speech silently. When you recite your speech over and over
                    while memorizing it, your brain multitasks and aids your memory retention.</p><br>
                  <b>4. Identify keys </b>
                  <p>  Identify a key point in every paragraph. Even if you miss out some of the words in
                    the actual speech delivery, you can easily expound on the key points.</p><br>
                  <b>5. Have a break </b>
                  <p> After memorizing some parts of your speech, take a break for some hours or for a
                    day. After this, recite the speech again. This will test how well you can recall what you think you
                    have memorized.</p><br>
                  <b>6. Record and listen </b>
                  <p> Record yourself delivering the speech and listen to it over and over again. Like
                    a song, the speech will get stuck in your head.</p><br>
                  <b>7. Use note cards </b>
                  <p> Write one key point on one note card. Bring these note cards wherever you go
                    and take them out whenever you have extra time to memorize, especially during idle times of the
                    day.</p><br>
